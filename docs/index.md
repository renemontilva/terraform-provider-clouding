# clouding Provider

**Disclaimer: Unofficial Terraform Provider for Clouding.io.**
			The Clouding provider is used to interact with the resources supported by Clouding API.
			The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# It is a good practice to use environment variables to store sensitive data
# like API keys, tokens, etc. This way, you can avoid committing them to your repository.

# First option, add a value to the token attribute
provider "clouding" {
  token = "token123"
}

# Second option, use an environment variable
# export CLOUDING_TOKEN=token123, it is not necessary to add the provider block
provider "clouding" {}
```
